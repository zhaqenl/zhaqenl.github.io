I am Raymund Martinez, and I’ve recently became a fan of 
[Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc), but it’ll be _Bed Driven_
for my case, because I don’t have a hammock. For the sake of throwing fancy words around, I like
going on spurts of pseudosystematic interval-based mentally stimulating activities, and the residue
of those stuff goes [here](/en/), hence, _Computing Residues_.
