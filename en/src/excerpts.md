##### Eliezer Yudkowsky


- [The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/)


- Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.


- Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.


- It is far better to say “magic,” than “complexity” or “emergence”; the latter
  words create an illusion of understanding. Wiser to say “magic,” and leave
  yourself a placeholder, a reminder of work you will have to do later.


- There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the
  prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse
  to give up.


- If you don’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are
  deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything
  at all?


- To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own
  errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not
  humble; it is boasting of your modesty.


- That which I cannot *eliminate* may be well worth *reducing*.


- So long as Lady Justice is investigating a *single*, strictly *factual*
  question, with a *binary* answer space, a set of scales would be an
  appropriate tool. If Justitia must consider any more complex issue, she should
  relinquish her scales or relinquish her sword.


- Reversed stupidity is not intelligence.


- Your instinctive willingness to believe something will change along with your
  willingness to *affiliate* with people who are known for believing it—quite
  apart from whether the belief is actually *true*.


- In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new
  clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has
  been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war,
  and we are soldiers.


##### Luke Muehlhauser


- You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive
  biases. You just *are* cognitive biases.


##### Marc Stiegler


- The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or
  pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”<br><br>The
  Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You
  mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color
  view . . .”


##### Jerry Cleaver


- What does you in is not failure to apply some high-level, intricate,
  complicated technique. It’s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on
  the ball.


##### Robin Hanson


- You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I
  don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your
  choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you
  may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are
  about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the
  way things are; anything else is a lie.


##### Pooh-Bah, in Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Mikado*


- Merely corroborative detail, intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an
  otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . . .


##### Wittgenstein


- A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of
  the mechanism.


##### [Nibble Stew](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2020/03/its-not-what-programming-languages-do.html)


- It’s not what programming languages do, it’s what they shepherd you to.


##### Alberto Brandolini


- It’s the assumption of the developers that goes to production.


##### Scott Adams


- If you manage your illusions wisely, you might get what you want, but you
  won’t necessarily understand why it worked.


##### Friedrich Nietzche


- Whoever fights monsters should see to it, that in the process, he does not
  become a monster.


##### Michael Bennet & Sarah Bennet


- The only book that can actually teach you how to change how others think is a
  lobotomy manual.


- Most of us have weird brains, and those who appear not to just haven’t exposed
  their own brains to the kinds of stress, relatives, or Japanese animation that
  will reveal their mental dysfunction.


- You need to accept that life is hard and your frustrated efforts are a
  valuable guide to identifying what you can’t change.


##### Carl Sagan


- One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long
  enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.


##### Robert Wright


- The human species is the human predicament.


##### Samuel Smiles


- A man can achieve almost anything by the exercise of his own free powers of
  action and self-denial. But he must be ever armed against the temptation of
  low indulgences, and must not defile his body by sensuality, nor his mind by
  servile thoughts.


##### Rumi


- You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand
  “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also
  understand “and.”


##### Antoine de Saint-Exupéry


- Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
  is nothing left to subtract.


##### François-Marie Arouet


- Perfect is the enemy of good.


##### Sheryl Sandberg


- If you’re offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask what seat. Just get
  on.
