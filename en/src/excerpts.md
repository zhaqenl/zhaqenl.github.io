##### Eliezer Yudkowsky


- [The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/)


- Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.


- Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.


- It is far better to say “magic,” than “complexity” or “emergence”; the latter
  words create an illusion of understanding. Wiser to say “magic,” and leave
  yourself a placeholder, a reminder of work you will have to do later.


- If you don’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are
  deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything
  at all?


##### Wittgenstein


- A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of
  the mechanism.


##### Scott Adams


- If you manage your illusions wisely, you might get what you want, but you
  won’t necessarily understand why it worked.


##### Friedrich Nietzche


- Whoever fights monsters should see to it, that in the process, he does not
  become a monster.


##### Michael Bennet & Sarah Bennet


- The only book that can actually teach you how to change how others think is a
  lobotomy manual.


- Most of us have weird brains, and those who appear not to just haven’t exposed
  their own brains to the kinds of stress, relatives, or Japanese animation that
  will reveal their mental dysfunction.


- You need to accept that life is hard and your frustrated efforts are a
  valuable guide to identifying what you can’t change.


##### Carl Sagan


- One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long
  enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.


##### Robert Wright


- The human species is the human predicament.


##### Samuel Smiles


- A man can achieve almost anything by the exercise of his own free powers of
  action and self-denial. But he must be ever armed against the temptation of
  low indulgences, and must not defile his body by sensuality, nor his mind by
  servile thoughts.


##### Rumi


- You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand
  “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also
  understand “and.”


##### Antoine de Saint-Exupéry


- Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
  is nothing left to subtract.


##### François-Marie Arouet


- Perfect is the enemy of good.


##### Sheryl Sandberg


- If you’re offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask what seat. Just get
  on.
