The page consists of excerpts from readings and people alike that just hit home.


##### Albert Einstein


- As our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness
  surrounding it.


##### Alberto Brandolini


- It’s the assumption of the developers that goes to production.


##### Antoine de Saint-Exupéry


- Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there
  is nothing left to subtract.


##### C. J. Cherryh


- Your sword has no blade. It has only your intention. When that goes astray you
  have no weapon.


##### Carl Sagan


- One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long
  enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.


##### Deadmau5


- [There are more lawyers in Disney than animators.](https://youtu.be/OZ9jjyDp0Ko?t=54)


##### Eliezer Yudkowsky (Rationality: From AI to Zombies)


- No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance, it only takes a single
  mistake to undo a human life, to outweigh every penny you picked up from the
  railroad tracks of stupidity.


- [The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/)


- Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.


- Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.


- It is far better to say “magic,” than “complexity” or “emergence”; the latter
  words create an illusion of understanding. Wiser to say “magic,” and leave
  yourself a placeholder, a reminder of work you will have to do later.


- There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the
  prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse
  to give up.


- If you don’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are
  deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything
  at all?


- To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own
  errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not
  humble; it is boasting of your modesty.


- That which I cannot *eliminate* may be well worth *reducing*.


- So long as Lady Justice is investigating a *single*, strictly *factual*
  question, with a *binary* answer space, a set of scales would be an
  appropriate tool. If Justitia must consider any more complex issue, she should
  relinquish her scales or relinquish her sword.


- Reversed stupidity is not intelligence.


- Your instinctive willingness to believe something will change along with your
  willingness to *affiliate* with people who are known for believing it—quite
  apart from whether the belief is actually *true*.


- In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new
  clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has
  been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war,
  and we are soldiers.


- You cannot “rationalize” what is not already rational. It is as if “lying”
  were called “truthization.”


- Science has heroes, but no gods. The great Names are not our superiors, or
  even our rivals; they are passed milestones on our road. And the most
  important milestone is the hero yet to come.


- It is the *resolution* of doubts, not the mere act of doubting, which drives
  the ratchet of rationality forward.


##### Feng Chen Wang


- ([On Deconstructing Stereotypes](https://youtu.be/sVCIhaAT83M?t=85)) A
  definition is just an arbitrary word. It doesn’t necessarily exist. I think
  definitions are just waiting to be shattered.<br><br>Take fashion for
  example. We often segment clothes by season or gender out of habit. That just
  begs to be deconstructed.


##### François-Marie Arouet


- Perfect is the enemy of good.


##### Friedrich Nietzche


- Whoever fights monsters should see to it, that in the process, he does not
  become a monster.


- But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself.


##### [u/igetasticker](https://www.reddit.com/user/igetasticker/)


- [(On free food and shelter) We give these things to prisoners because they are considered basic human rights. Makes you wonder why we don’t provide them to everyone else.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/kbemzj/you_get_given_free_food_and_shelter_for_life_for/gfh7yvm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)


##### Jason Stoddard


- Don’t suck by pricing things at what the market will bear, rather than what is
  fair based on your cost of production.


##### Jayne Goheen


- You have to have darkness to see light. Often times we experience beauty
  because we can put that against recognizing ugliness.


##### Jerry Cleaver


- What does you in is not failure to apply some high-level, intricate,
  complicated technique. It’s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on
  the ball.


##### Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson (The Elephant in the Brain)


- The deeper logic of many of our strangest and most unique behaviors may lie in
  their value as signals.


- Judge freely, and accept that you too will be judged.


- Just as camouflage is useful when facing an adversary with eyes,
  self-deception can be useful when facing an adversary with mind-reading
  powers.


- In general, we prefer explanations that make us look good, whether as
  individuals, families, communities, or nations. When it comes to our rivals,
  we’re perfectly happy to entertain unflattering theories about their behavior,
  as long as the mud we fling at them doesn’t spatter too much back at us.


##### Luke Muehlhauser


- You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive
  biases. You just *are* cognitive biases.


##### Marc Stiegler


- The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or
  pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”<br><br>The
  Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You
  mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color
  view . . .”


##### Mark Manson


- ...it is impossible to become someone new without first grieving the loss of
  who you used to be.


##### Michael Bennet & Sarah Bennet (F*ck Feelings)


- The only book that can actually teach you how to change how others think is a
  lobotomy manual.


- Most of us have weird brains, and those who appear not to just haven’t exposed
  their own brains to the kinds of stress, relatives, or Japanese animation that
  will reveal their mental dysfunction.


- You need to accept that life is hard and your frustrated efforts are a
  valuable guide to identifying what you can’t change.


##### [Nibble Stew](https://nibblestew.blogspot.com)


- It’s not what programming languages do, it’s what they shepherd you to.


- Being right is easy. Being relevant is extremely difficult.


##### Pooh-Bah, in Gilbert and Sullivan’s *The Mikado*


- Merely corroborative detail, intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an
  otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . . .


##### Quentin Crisp


- Fashion is what you adopt when you don’t know who you are.


- If there were no applause and no criticism, who would you be?


##### Ralph Waldo Emerson


- Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy
  begins.


##### Robert Wright


- The human species is the human predicament.


##### Robin Hanson


- You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I
  don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your
  choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you
  may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are
  about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the
  way things are; anything else is a lie.


##### Rommel MARTINEZ


- News is never a source of knowledge—it’s sweets for the mind.


##### Rumi


- You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand
  “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also
  understand “and.”


##### Samuel Smiles


- A man can achieve almost anything by the exercise of his own free powers of
  action and self-denial. But he must be ever armed against the temptation of
  low indulgences, and must not defile his body by sensuality, nor his mind by
  servile thoughts.


##### Scott


- (On COVID) It’s the first time in my life that I had more alcohol on me than
  in me.


##### Scott Adams


- If you manage your illusions wisely, you might get what you want, but you
  won’t necessarily understand why it worked.


##### Sheryl Sandberg


- If you’re offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask what seat. Just get
  on.


##### Teddy Baldassarre


- [There’s minimalism as a pursuit, and then there’s minimalism as a way of absence of thought, so it’s not intended minimalism, it’s just minimalism based on the fact that there is no thought going into the design...](https://youtu.be/M27ZJx4B994?t=942)


- [The world lies to you all the time, I don’t think it’s ever a good idea to lie to yourself...](https://youtu.be/PFjYt66h_i4?t=1510)


##### Tom Scott


- [Entropy will get us all in the end.](https://youtu.be/BxV14h0kFs0?t=555)


##### Walter Kotschnig


- Let us keep our minds open, by all means... But don’t keep your minds so open
  that your brains fall out!


##### Wittgenstein


- A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of
  the mechanism.


##### ???


- It is not a justice system, it is a legal system.
