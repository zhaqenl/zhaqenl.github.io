Musings I come up with, more often than not, during random moments.

- Capacity first, tolerance later.<br>


- Playing fairly in a place where injustice is one of the rules, you’ll always
  get beaten.<br>


- Consequences are not only for those making mistakes, but also for those
  avoiding them.<br>


- You might have read the book, but did you listen to the author.<br>


- (On making things happen) If you can’t even picture it in your head, you’re
  not even at the starting line.<br><br>That being said, this might be one of
  the markers if you have a natural inclination towards making something happen
  or being able to participate in it.


- Work is the easy part.<br>


- Chance ignorance is episodic bliss, directed ignorance is consummate freedom.<br>


- The universe is not under any kind of obligation to make sense.<br>


- What do you do when you’re at the brink of doing something you spent your life
  trying to avoid?<br>


- When two beings collide, the one with more to lose does not matter. What
  matters is who fears to lose what he has.<br>


- The difference between these modes of communication lie in the proportion
  between viscerality and accountability.<br>


- As interesting as the “why” is the “why not.”<br>


- No big fish grows on clear waters–the big fish, however, ended up in a skillet.


- It should have never been “You can’t please everyone”, but instead “You should
  not please everyone”. As an adage says—“If you please everyone, you please no one.”


- Our addictions have always been the result of chasing a certain hormonal profile.


- Having too early of a dominance robs the fun out of it, even undermines it.


- Change lives, business follows.


- We’re not always the good guys.


- Tell me ‘how’ and ‘when’ you spike your dopamine, and I’ll tell you who you are.


- Over-application of one thing tends to imply under-application of another, and
  vice-versa.


- To Andrew Huberman’s “Addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that
  bring you pleasure.”, I say instead—“Addiction is a progressive narrowing
  **and layering** of the things that bring you pleasure.”


- Manage your addictions, but acknowledge them first.
