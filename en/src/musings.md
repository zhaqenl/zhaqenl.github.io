Musings

Musings I come up with, more often than not, during random moments.

- Work is the easy part.<br>


- Chance ignorance is episodic bliss, directed ignorance is consummate freedom.<br>


- The universe is not under any kind of obligation to make sense.<br>


- What do you do when you’re at the brink of doing something you spent your life
  trying to avoid?<br>


- When two beings collide, the one with more to lose does not matter. What
  matters is who fears to lose what he has.<br>


- The difference between these modes of communication lie in the proportion
  between viscerality and accountability.<br>


- As interesting as the “why” is the “why not.”<br>


- No big fish grows on clear waters–the big fish, however, ended up in a skillet.
