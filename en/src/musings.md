Musings

<div class="center">September 2, 2019</div>

The page consists of musings I come up with, more often than not, during
lightbulb moments.

- Chance ignorance is episodic bliss, directed ignorance is consummate freedom.<br>


- The universe is not under any kind of obligation to make sense.<br>


- What do you do when youâ€™re at the brink of doing something you spent your life
  trying to avoid?<br>


- When two beings collide, the one with more to lose does not matter. What
  matters is who fears to lose what he has.<br>


- The difference between these modes of communication lie in the proportion
  between viscerality and accountability.<br>
