Learn to spike dopamine from effort itself.</li></ul><h5>Anonymous</h5><ul><li>It is not a justice system, it is a legal system.</li></ul><ul><li>The man who loves walking will walk further than the man who loves the  destination.</li></ul><ul><li>Don't steal a candle to read the Bible.</li></ul><h5>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</h5><ul><li>Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there  is nothing left to subtract.</li></ul><h5>Bessel van der Kolk</h5><ul><li>All trauma is preverbal.</li></ul><h5>Bryce Krawczyk</h5><ul><li>You need to <strong>earn</strong> the right to have <strong>high expectations</strong> of  yourself. Expectations have to be <strong>realistic</strong>—so you need to invest in the  process and details of your training and recovery, before you get to expect  big things from yourself.</li></ul><h5>C. J. Cherryh</h5><ul><li>Your sword has no blade. It has only your intention. When that goes astray you  have no weapon.</li></ul><h5>Carl Jung</h5><ul><li>Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s  conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.</li></ul><h5>Carl Sagan</h5><ul><li>One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long  enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.</li></ul><h5>Catherynne M. Valente</h5><ul><li>...the beginning is where the end gets born.</li></ul><h5>Deadmau5</h5><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/OZ9jjyDp0Ko?t=54'>Source</a>: There are more lawyers in Disney than animators.</li></ul><h5>Denzel Washington</h5><ul><li>When you pray for rain, you gotta deal with the mud too.</li></ul><h5>Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence</h5><ul><li>An expected reward that fails to materialize is worse than a reward that was  never anticipated in the first place.</li></ul><h5>Eliezer Yudkowsky (Rationality: From AI to Zombies)</h5><ul><li>No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance, it only takes a single  mistake to undo a human life, to outweigh every penny you picked up from the  railroad tracks of stupidity.</li></ul><ul><li><a href='https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/'>Source</a>: The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.</li></ul><ul><li>Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.</li></ul><ul><li>Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.</li></ul><ul><li>It is far better to say “magic,” than “complexity” or “emergence”; the latter  words create an illusion of understanding. Wiser to say “magic,” and leave  yourself a placeholder, a reminder of work you will have to do later.</li></ul><ul><li>There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the  prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse  to give up.</li></ul><ul><li>If you don’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are  deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything  at all?</li></ul><ul><li>To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own  errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not  humble; it is boasting of your modesty.</li></ul><ul><li>That which I cannot <em>eliminate</em> may be well worth <em>reducing</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>So long as Lady Justice is investigating a <em>single</em>, strictly <em>factual</em>  question, with a <em>binary</em> answer space, a set of scales would be an  appropriate tool. If Justitia must consider any more complex issue, she should  relinquish her scales or relinquish her sword.</li></ul><ul><li>Reversed stupidity is not intelligence.</li></ul><ul><li>Your instinctive willingness to believe something will change along with your  willingness to <em>affiliate</em> with people who are known for believing it—quite  apart from whether the belief is actually <em>true</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new  clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has  been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war,  and we are soldiers.</li></ul><ul><li>You cannot “rationalize” what is not already rational. It is as if “lying”  were called “truthization.”</li></ul><ul><li>Science has heroes, but no gods. The great Names are not our superiors, or  even our rivals; they are passed milestones on our road. And the most  important milestone is the hero yet to come.</li></ul><ul><li>It is the <em>resolution</em> of doubts, not the mere act of doubting, which drives  the ratchet of rationality forward.</li></ul><h5>Ellsworth “Bumpy” Johnson</h5><ul><li>That’s the way it is now: You can’t find the heart of anything to stick the knife.</li></ul><h5>Elwyn Brooks White</h5><ul><li>I get up every morning determined to both change the world and have one hell  of a good time. Sometimes this makes planning my day difficult.</li></ul><h5>Feng Chen Wang</h5><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/sVCIhaAT83M?t=85'>Source</a>: (On Deconstructing Stereotypes) A  definition is just an arbitrary word. It doesn’t necessarily exist. I think  definitions are just waiting to be shattered.<br><br>Take fashion for  example. We often segment clothes by season or gender out of habit. That just  begs to be deconstructed.</li></ul><h5>François-Marie Arouet</h5><ul><li>Perfect is the enemy of good.</li></ul><h5>Friedrich Nietzche</h5><ul><li>Madness is something rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, peoples, and  ages, it is the rule.</li></ul><ul><li>Whoever fights monsters should see to it, that in the process, he does not  become a monster.</li></ul><ul><li>But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself.</li></ul><h5>Gabor Maté</h5><ul><li>Trauma is not what happens to you but what happens <em>inside</em> you.</li></ul><ul><li>The usual conception of trauma conjures up notions of catastrophic events:  hurricanes, abuse, egregious neglect, and war. This has the unintended and  misleading effect of relegating trauma to the realm of the abnormal, the  unusual, and the exceptional.<br><br>If there exists a class of people we call  “traumatized”, that must mean that most of us are not. Here we miss the mark  by a wide margin.<br><br>Trauma pervades our culture, from personal  functioning through social relationships, parenting, education, popular  culture, economics, and politics. In fact, someone <em>without</em> the marks of  trauma would be an outlier in our society.<br><br>We are closer to the truth  when we ask: Where do we each fit on the broad and surprisingly inclusive  trauma spectrum? Which of its many marks has each of us carried all (or most)  of our lives, and what have the impacts been? And what possibilities would  open up were we to become more familiar, even intimate, with them?</li></ul><h5>Hacker News</h5><ul><li><a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15659076'>Source</a>: Entrepreneurship is  like one of those carnival games where you throw darts or something.  Middle  class kids can afford one throw. Most miss. A few hit the target and get a  small prize. A very few hit the center bullseye and get a bigger prize. Rags  to riches! The American Dream lives on.<br><br>Rich kids can afford many  throws. If they want to, they can try over and over and over again until they  hit something and feel good about themselves. Some keep going until they hit  the center bullseye, then they give speeches or write blog posts about  "meritocracy" and the salutary effects of hard work.<br><br>Poor kids aren't visiting the carnival. They're the ones working it.</li></ul><h5>Janina Vela</h5><ul><li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Wjnbl2hzJo'>Source</a>: The retelling of the oppression of the Marcoses does not negate the oppression from any other political family.<br><br>The fight for #NeverAgain, #NeverForget is not about the condemnation of one family, nor the glorification of another. This is about the fight for the justice that Filipinos never got.</li></ul><h5>Jason Stoddard</h5><ul><li>Don’t suck by pricing things at what the market will bear, rather than what is  fair based on your cost of production.</li></ul><h5>Jayne Goheen</h5><ul><li>You have to have darkness to see light. Often times we experience beauty  because we can put that against recognizing ugliness.</li></ul><h5>Jerry Cleaver</h5><ul><li>What does you in is not failure to apply some high-level, intricate,  complicated technique. It’s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on  the ball.</li></ul><h5>John F. Kennedy</h5><ul><li>The great enemy of truth is very often not the lie—deliberate, contrived and  dishonest—but the myth—persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. Too often we  hold fast to the cliches of our forebears. We subject all facts to a  prefabricated set of interpretations. We enjoy the comfort of opinion without  the discomfort of thought.</li></ul><h5>Keith Richards</h5><ul><li>All the contortions we go through just not to be ourselves for a few hours.</li></ul><h5>Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson (The Elephant in the Brain)</h5><ul><li>The deeper logic of many of our strangest and most unique behaviors may lie in  their value as signals.</li></ul><ul><li>Judge freely, and accept that you too will be judged.</li></ul><ul><li>Just as camouflage is useful when facing an adversary with eyes,  self-deception can be useful when facing an adversary with mind-reading  powers.</li></ul><ul><li>In general, we prefer explanations that make us look good, whether as  individuals, families, communities, or nations. When it comes to our rivals,  we’re perfectly happy to entertain unflattering theories about their behavior,  as long as the mud we fling at them doesn’t spatter too much back at us.</li></ul><h5>Lord Acton</h5><ul><li>Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.</li></ul><h5>Luke Muehlhauser</h5><ul><li>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive  biases. You just <em>are</em> cognitive biases.</li></ul><h5>Malcolm Gladwell</h5><ul><li>You believe someone not because you have no doubts about them. Belief is not  the absence of doubt. You believe someone because you don’t have enough doubts  about them.</li></ul><ul><li>...we have built a world that systematically discriminates against a class of  people who, through no fault of their own, violate our ridiculous ideas about  transparency.</li></ul><h5>Marc Stiegler</h5><ul><li>The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or  pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”<br><br>The  Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You  mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color  view . . .”</li></ul><h5>Mark Manson</h5><ul><li>...it is impossible to become someone new without first grieving the loss of  who you used to be.</li></ul><h5>Michael Bennet & Sarah Bennet (F*ck Feelings)</h5><ul><li>The only book that can actually teach you how to change how others think is a  lobotomy manual.</li></ul><ul><li>Most of us have weird brains, and those who appear not to just haven’t exposed  their own brains to the kinds of stress, relatives, or Japanese animation that  will reveal their mental dysfunction.</li></ul><ul><li>You need to accept that life is hard and your frustrated efforts are a  valuable guide to identifying what you can’t change.</li></ul><h5><a href='https://nibblestew.blogspot.com'>Nibble Stew</a></h5><ul><li>It’s not what programming languages do, it’s what they shepherd you to.</li></ul><ul><li>Being right is easy.

It barely hints at the submerged strata of <em>primal implicit experience</em>  that moves us in ways the conscious mind can only begin to imagine.</li></ul><h5>Pooh-Bah, in Gilbert and Sullivan’s <em>The Mikado</em></h5><ul><li>Merely corroborative detail, intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an  otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . . .</li></ul><h5>Quentin Crisp</h5><ul><li>Fashion is what you adopt when you don’t know who you are.</li></ul><ul><li>If there were no applause and no criticism, who would you be?</li></ul><h5>Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5><ul><li>Every man alone is sincere.

Ever! You are not even entitled to “I  don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your  choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you  may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are  about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the  way things are; anything else is a lie.</li></ul><h5>Rommel MARTINEZ</h5><ul><li>News is never a source of knowledge—it’s sweets for the mind.</li></ul><h5>Rumi</h5><ul><li>You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand  “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also  understand “and.”</li></ul><h5>Samuel Smiles</h5><ul><li>A man can achieve almost anything by the exercise of his own free powers of  action and self-denial. But he must be ever armed against the temptation of  low indulgences, and must not defile his body by sensuality, nor his mind by  servile thoughts.</li></ul><h5>Scientific Principles of Strength Training</h5><ul><li>Because specificity and variation are in many ways mirror-images of each  other, over-applications of specificity may be under-applications of variation  and vice-versa.</li></ul><h5>Scott</h5><ul><li>(On COVID) It’s the first time in my life that I had more alcohol on me than  in me.</li></ul><h5>Scott Adams</h5><ul><li>If you manage your illusions wisely, you might get what you want, but you  won’t necessarily understand why it worked.</li></ul><h5>Sheryl Sandberg</h5><ul><li>If you’re offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask what seat.
