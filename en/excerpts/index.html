J. Cherryh</h5><ul><li>Your sword has no blade. It has only your intention. When that goes astray you  have no weapon.</li></ul><h5>Carl Jung</h5><ul><li>Everyone carries a shadow, and the less it is embodied in the individual’s  conscious life, the blacker and denser it is.</li></ul><h5>Carl Sagan</h5><ul><li>One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long  enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle.</li></ul><h5>Deadmau5</h5><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/OZ9jjyDp0Ko?t=54'>There are more lawyers in Disney than animators.</a></li></ul><h5>Eliezer Yudkowsky (Rationality: From AI to Zombies)</h5><ul><li>No matter how many days go by in blissful ignorance, it only takes a single  mistake to undo a human life, to outweigh every penny you picked up from the  railroad tracks of stupidity.</li></ul><ul><li><a href='https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/01/14/hottest/'>The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who in time of crisis remain neutral.</a></li></ul><ul><li>Rational thought produces beliefs which are themselves evidence.</li></ul><ul><li>Mystery is a property of questions, not answers.</li></ul><ul><li>It is far better to say “magic,” than “complexity” or “emergence”; the latter  words create an illusion of understanding. Wiser to say “magic,” and leave  yourself a placeholder, a reminder of work you will have to do later.</li></ul><ul><li>There are some mental searches that we secretly wish would fail; and when the  prospect of success is uncomfortable, people take the earliest possible excuse  to give up.</li></ul><ul><li>If you don’t have enough experience to regenerate beliefs when they are  deleted, then do you have enough experience to connect that belief to anything  at all?</li></ul><ul><li>To be humble is to take specific actions in anticipation of your own  errors. To confess your fallibility and then do nothing about it is not  humble; it is boasting of your modesty.</li></ul><ul><li>That which I cannot <em>eliminate</em> may be well worth <em>reducing</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>So long as Lady Justice is investigating a <em>single</em>, strictly <em>factual</em>  question, with a <em>binary</em> answer space, a set of scales would be an  appropriate tool. If Justitia must consider any more complex issue, she should  relinquish her scales or relinquish her sword.</li></ul><ul><li>Reversed stupidity is not intelligence.</li></ul><ul><li>Your instinctive willingness to believe something will change along with your  willingness to <em>affiliate</em> with people who are known for believing it—quite  apart from whether the belief is actually <em>true</em>.</li></ul><ul><li>In all human history, every great leap forward has been driven by a new  clarity of thought. Except for a few natural catastrophes, every great woe has  been driven by a stupidity. Our last enemy is ourselves; and this is a war,  and we are soldiers.</li></ul><ul><li>You cannot “rationalize” what is not already rational. It is as if “lying”  were called “truthization.”</li></ul><ul><li>Science has heroes, but no gods. The great Names are not our superiors, or  even our rivals; they are passed milestones on our road. And the most  important milestone is the hero yet to come.</li></ul><ul><li>It is the <em>resolution</em> of doubts, not the mere act of doubting, which drives  the ratchet of rationality forward.</li></ul><h5>Feng Chen Wang</h5><ul><li>(<a href='https://youtu.be/sVCIhaAT83M?t=85'>On Deconstructing Stereotypes</a>) A  definition is just an arbitrary word. It doesn’t necessarily exist. I think  definitions are just waiting to be shattered.<br><br>Take fashion for  example. We often segment clothes by season or gender out of habit. That just  begs to be deconstructed.</li></ul><h5>François-Marie Arouet</h5><ul><li>Perfect is the enemy of good.</li></ul><h5>Friedrich Nietzche</h5><ul><li>Madness is something rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, peoples, and  ages, it is the rule.</li></ul><ul><li>Whoever fights monsters should see to it, that in the process, he does not  become a monster.</li></ul><ul><li>But the worst enemy you can meet will always be yourself.</li></ul><h5><a href='https://www.reddit.com/user/igetasticker/'>u/igetasticker</a></h5><ul><li><a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/kbemzj/you_get_given_free_food_and_shelter_for_life_for/gfh7yvm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3'>(On free food and shelter) We give these things to prisoners because they are considered basic human rights. Makes you wonder why we don’t provide them to everyone else.</a></li></ul><h5>Jason Stoddard</h5><ul><li>Don’t suck by pricing things at what the market will bear, rather than what is  fair based on your cost of production.</li></ul><h5>Jayne Goheen</h5><ul><li>You have to have darkness to see light. Often times we experience beauty  because we can put that against recognizing ugliness.</li></ul><h5>Jerry Cleaver</h5><ul><li>What does you in is not failure to apply some high-level, intricate,  complicated technique. It’s overlooking the basics. Not keeping your eye on  the ball.</li></ul><h5>Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson (The Elephant in the Brain)</h5><ul><li>The deeper logic of many of our strangest and most unique behaviors may lie in  their value as signals.</li></ul><ul><li>Judge freely, and accept that you too will be judged.</li></ul><ul><li>Just as camouflage is useful when facing an adversary with eyes,  self-deception can be useful when facing an adversary with mind-reading  powers.</li></ul><ul><li>In general, we prefer explanations that make us look good, whether as  individuals, families, communities, or nations. When it comes to our rivals,  we’re perfectly happy to entertain unflattering theories about their behavior,  as long as the mud we fling at them doesn’t spatter too much back at us.</li></ul><h5>Luke Muehlhauser</h5><ul><li>You are not a Bayesian homunculus whose reasoning is “corrupted” by cognitive  biases. You just <em>are</em> cognitive biases.</li></ul><h5>Marc Stiegler</h5><ul><li>The Sophisticate: “The world isn’t black and white. No one does pure good or  pure bad. It’s all gray. Therefore, no one is better than anyone else.”<br><br>The  Zetet: “Knowing only gray, you conclude that all grays are the same shade. You  mock the simplicity of the two-color view, yet you replace it with a one-color  view . . .”</li></ul><h5>Mark Manson</h5><ul><li>...it is impossible to become someone new without first grieving the loss of  who you used to be.</li></ul><h5>Michael Bennet & Sarah Bennet (F*ck Feelings)</h5><ul><li>The only book that can actually teach you how to change how others think is a  lobotomy manual.</li></ul><ul><li>Most of us have weird brains, and those who appear not to just haven’t exposed  their own brains to the kinds of stress, relatives, or Japanese animation that  will reveal their mental dysfunction.</li></ul><ul><li>You need to accept that life is hard and your frustrated efforts are a  valuable guide to identifying what you can’t change.</li></ul><h5><a href='https://nibblestew.blogspot.com'>Nibble Stew</a></h5><ul><li>It’s not what programming languages do, it’s what they shepherd you to.</li></ul><ul><li>Being right is easy. Being relevant is extremely difficult.</li></ul><h5>Pooh-Bah, in Gilbert and Sullivan’s <em>The Mikado</em></h5><ul><li>Merely corroborative detail, intended to give artistic verisimilitude to an  otherwise bald and unconvincing narrative . . .</li></ul><h5>Pericles</h5><ul><li>What I fear is not the enemy’s strategy, but our own mistakes.</li></ul><h5>Quentin Crisp</h5><ul><li>Fashion is what you adopt when you don’t know who you are.</li></ul><ul><li>If there were no applause and no criticism, who would you be?</li></ul><h5>Ralph Waldo Emerson</h5><ul><li>Every man alone is sincere. At the entrance of a second person, hypocrisy  begins.</li></ul><ul><li>The years teach much which the days never know.</li></ul><h5>Robert Greene</h5><ul><li>To waste your time in battles not of your choosing is more than just a  mistake, it is stupidity of the highest order.</li></ul><h5>Robert Wright</h5><ul><li>The human species is the human predicament.</li></ul><h5>Robin Hanson</h5><ul><li>You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I  don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your  choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you  may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are  about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the  way things are; anything else is a lie.</li></ul><h5>Rommel MARTINEZ</h5><ul><li>News is never a source of knowledge—it’s sweets for the mind.</li></ul><h5>Rumi</h5><ul><li>You think that because you understand “one” that you must therefore understand  “two” because one and one make two. But you forget that you must also  understand “and.”</li></ul><h5>Samuel Smiles</h5><ul><li>A man can achieve almost anything by the exercise of his own free powers of  action and self-denial. But he must be ever armed against the temptation of  low indulgences, and must not defile his body by sensuality, nor his mind by  servile thoughts.</li></ul><h5>Scott</h5><ul><li>(On COVID) It’s the first time in my life that I had more alcohol on me than  in me.</li></ul><h5>Scott Adams</h5><ul><li>If you manage your illusions wisely, you might get what you want, but you  won’t necessarily understand why it worked.</li></ul><h5>Sheryl Sandberg</h5><ul><li>If you’re offered a seat on a rocket, don't ask what seat. Just get  on.</li></ul><h5>Stefan Zweig</h5><ul><li>Darkness must fall before we are aware of the majesty of the stars above our heads.</li></ul><h5>Teddy Baldassarre</h5><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/M27ZJx4B994?t=942'>There’s minimalism as a pursuit, and then there’s minimalism as a way of absence of thought, so it’s not intended minimalism, it’s just minimalism based on the fact that there is no thought going into the design...</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/PFjYt66h_i4?t=1510'>The world lies to you all the time, I don’t think it’s ever a good idea to lie to yourself...</a></li></ul><h5>The I Ching</h5><ul><li>Chaos—where brilliant dreams are born.</li></ul><h5>Tom Scott</h5><ul><li><a href='https://youtu.be/BxV14h0kFs0?t=555'>Entropy will get us all in the end.</a></li></ul><h5>Walter Kotschnig</h5><ul><li>Let us keep our minds open, by all means... But don’t keep your minds so open  that your brains fall out!</li></ul><h5>Wittgenstein</h5><ul><li>A wheel that can be turned though nothing else moves with it, is not part of  the mechanism.</li></ul><h5>???</h5><ul><li>It is not a justice system, it is a legal system.</li></ul><hr/><div class="footer"><p><div class="text-small"> <a href='/en'>Home</a> · <a href='/en/excerpts'>Excerpts</a> · <a href='/en/musings'>Musings</a> · <a href='/en/about'>About</a> · <a href='https://github.com/zhaqenl/zhaqenl.github.io'>Source</a> </div> <div class="text-x-small"> Created with <a href='https://github.com/ebzzry/emem'>emem</a> and <a href='https://github.com/ebzzry/skeleton'>skeleton</a> <div></p><p><div class="text-x-small"> <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en"><img alt="CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication" class="cc" src="/pictures/cc0-88x31.png" /></a><br> This work is in the <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en">public domain.</a><br> </div></p><p></div></p></div><script src="/static/js/highlight.pack.js"></script><script>hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();</script><script>(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');ga('create', 'UA-121960562-1', 'auto');ga('send', 'pageview');</script></body></html>
